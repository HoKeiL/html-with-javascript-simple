<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Nichard Rg.</p>
<p>My three favourite foods are:</p>
<h2>Musing of the month (March 2003)</h2>
<p>
  <b>
    Q: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    A: A woodchuck would chuck all the wood they could chuck if a woodchuck
    would chuck wood.
  </i>
</p>
<h2>Numbers</h2>
<p>Currently, my two favourite numbers are <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>.</p>
<p>Here's how they interact:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sum, 2 + 3 = 5</li>
  <li>Product, 2 x 3 = 6</li>
  <li>Division (a), 2 / 3 = 0.67</li>
  <li>Division (b), 3 / 2 = 1.5</li>
</ol>
